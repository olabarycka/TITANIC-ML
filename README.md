# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and preparing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, class, gender, fare, and more. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can classify each passenger as a survivor (1) or a victim (0).

## Part 1 – Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Objectives:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and potential issues.

Clean the dataset: handle missing values, remove irrelevant features.

Feature engineering: create at least two new columns that enhance predictive power.

Encode categorical features appropriately for machine learning models.

Detect and handle outliers in numerical and categorical features.

Visualize each feature (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots) to understand relationships and distributions.

## Part 2 – Machine Learning Models

Objectives:

Train models to predict survival using cleaned and preprocessed data.

Avoid data leakage: separate training and test sets.

Create a baseline using DummyClassifier for comparison.

Evaluate at least two machine learning models.

Investigate hyperparameters: tune at least two per model to improve performance.

Evaluate models using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualize results to interpret model behavior and hyperparameter impact.
